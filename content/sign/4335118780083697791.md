Freeway Entrance on I-86 east.  This style sign assembly for freeway entrances is not very common in Idaho.  Also, note that the I-86 shield has the text IDAHO in it, which is also pretty rare.  Most of the interstate shields that have the text IDAHO in them are older.  This sign appears to be newer.
