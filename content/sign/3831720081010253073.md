UT-30 west approaching UT-42.  Use UT-42 for Boise (Idaho).  Continue west (turn left) on UT-30 for Park Valley, Grouse Creek, and Elko (Nevada).  Boise is an interesting destination city to put on this sign since Boise is on the entire other side of the state from where UT-42 crosses into Idaho.  Malta, or even Burley would be more appropriate.
