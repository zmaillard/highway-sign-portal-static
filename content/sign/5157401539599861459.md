I-240 East/US-70 East at Exits 4A and 4B.  Exit 4A (Left) - Future I-26 West/US-19/US-23/US-70 West/UNC Asheville/Weaverville/Woodfin.  Exit 4B - Patton Ave./Downtown.  Continue ahead for I-240 East/US-70 East/ Expressway.  I-26 becomes Future I-26 before this intersection because parts of the highway are not up to interstate standards.
