Mills Ave. west at NM-518. Use NM-518 north for Storrie Lake (State Park), Mora, and Taos. From the documentation I can find, it appears that Mills Ave. was formerly signed as NM-329.  There were no NM-329 shields along Mills Ave. in 2013, when this picture was taken.  This is also the southern end of NM-518, which used to extend south through Las Vegas to BL-25.
