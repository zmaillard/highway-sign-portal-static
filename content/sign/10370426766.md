BL-25 North (Grand Ave.) at NM-329 (New Mexico Ave.).  This sign assembly says that New Mexico Ave. leads to NM-329.  It appears that NM-329 runs down New Mexico Ave. and intersects Grand Ave. here, and the TO text is erroneous.  Turn left on NM-329 for New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute and Luna Community College.
