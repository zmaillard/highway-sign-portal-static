I-90 east approaching Exit 23 - Pompeys Pillar.  Pompeys Pillar is a sandstone outcrop, that is special because it has a signature of William Clark, from the Lewis and Clark expedition engraved in it.  William Clark named Pompeys Pillar after Sacagawea's infant son Jean Baptiste, whom Clark had nicknamed Pompey.
