US-97 south at OR-370 to O'Neill and Lone Pine.  OR-370 is not signed as such at this junction, but is part of the O'Neil Highway.  This is part of the Oregon State Highway system that did not have a posted route number.  In recent years the Oregon Department of Transportation has been assigning numbers to routes that have previously been unsigned.
