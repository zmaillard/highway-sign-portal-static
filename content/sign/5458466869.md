I-84 west at Exit 38 - BL-84/Garrity Blvd./Idaho Center Blvd.  I-84 heads west towards Caldwell and Ontario (Oregon).  Oddly, there are two different control cities for two different sets of lanes.  Through Nampa, all through traffic is urged to use the left lanes, so it does not make since why Ontario bound traffic use the left most lane.
