NV-208 north approaching Alt. US-95 north in Yerrington.  Below the Alt. US-95 shield is a Nevada post mile marker.  Nevada state and US highways do not have traditional mile markers, but instead have these post mile markers.  The mileage on these markers reset at each county line.  The top line is the route type, in this case SR (State Route).  The next line is the two character county abbreviation - LY for Lyon County.  The number is the actual mileage, to two decimal places.
