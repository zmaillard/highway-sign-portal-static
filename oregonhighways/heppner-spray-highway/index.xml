Milepost 90 (B) on US-395 south. The C is because the state of Oregon maintains different internal highways along the state highway system. Some of the signed highways (like OR-207) span multiple internal highways. In this case this is the third internal highway south from the beginning of OR-207 at US-730 that belongs only to OR-207. The first (Hermiston Highway #333) is marked as an A on mileposts.</description></item><item><title>OR-207 North - Distance Marker</title><link>https://preview.roadsign.pictures/sign/4683967036592803146/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2017 12:27:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://preview.roadsign.pictures/sign/4683967036592803146/</guid><description>Distance marker on OR-207 north.
