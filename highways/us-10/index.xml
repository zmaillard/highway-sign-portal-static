This is interesting in a few ways. First of all, the stacking of the route numbers within the marker itself. Secondly - US-10 is decommissioned in the western US. US-195 used to end in Sandpoint, ID - following the current route of US-2 through Spokane. Currently US-195 ends a few miles to the west at I-90. Finally, there is no mention of I-90 on this sign, which is where this sign is posted at an onramp to I-90.</description></item></channel></rss>
